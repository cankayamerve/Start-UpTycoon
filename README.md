Welcome to our game, where your journey starts by choosing your gender and username. Upon starting, you're given an initial fund of 100,000 in-game currency. With this, you can purchase projects and hire developers available in our marketplace. The aim of this game is to become the player reaching a million at the earliest.

Each year, you're allowed to buy only one project. Acquired projects and hired developers are displayed on widgets at the corners of your screen. You can link owned projects with hired developers using the 'Matching' button. Remember, a developer can only work on one project at a time. Matching the project's specialty with the developer's specialty brings profit. But this profit may not be enough for you. Also the primary objective is to finish the game in the shortest time possible.

Our developers have secret specialties unknown to users. If the user takes a risk and assigns a developer to a project that does not match their specialty, and as a result, the developer matches a project with a secret specialty, the potential return will be significantly higher. This adds an element of chance and risk to expedite the game. This element of chance keeps the game dynamic, avoiding repetitive outcomes in every playthrough.

Moreover, users have the freedom to remove owned projects and dismiss developers.

Here's the catch: a developer currently working on a project cannot be fired. If an unassigned developer remains, the user can decide whether to keep paying them annually or dismiss them. When removing a project, any developers solely associated with that project will also be terminated. Additionally, at the end of each year, your overall profit or loss is calculated based on specific algorithms. Your net profit is then displayed on the screen.
