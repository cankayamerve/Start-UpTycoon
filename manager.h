/**
 * @brief The Manager class represents an employee specializing in management roles.
 *
 * This class is derived from the Employee class and extends its functionality by
 * incorporating additional attributes related to management. Each Manager has a
 * speciality (publicly accessible), and the salary is specified separately. The Manager
 * class allows for the encapsulation of information regarding the specific skills and
 * expertise of an employee in the field of management.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * \code
 *     Speciality managerSpeciality("Project Management");
 *     Manager manager(managerSpeciality, "Ahmet GÃ¼l", 90000, 2015);
 *
 *     QString managerName = manager.getName();
 *     Speciality managerSpeciality = manager.getSpeciality();
 *     int managerSalary = manager.getSalary();
 * \endcode
